Welcome to Cyber Radio 1 !


Cyber Radio 1 is the distribution name of the live Internet audio
broadcast system that I wrote for the Georiga Tech student radio
station, WREK Atlanta 91.1 FM. WREK has been using this system for the
past year under the name WREK-NET.


Cyber Radio 1 is a client/server system. The server continually reads
digital data from the audio device (e.g. /dev/audio) and multiplexes it
out to any number of connected clients. Connected clients in turn,
receive the digital audio data to play out of their audio device.


The Cyber Radio 1 system has been tested to work with any Sun Sparc,
Linux, or BSD system with an audio device. The client program will work
on any SGI workstation as well.  It's reported that it should work on
HP/UX workstations as well. It could potentially work on NeXT machines
and other systems with minimal hacking. There is no reason why a
Windows version couldn't be made.



Cyber Radio 1 consists of the following programs:

     A server program. 

     A client program. 

     A server utility program that displays current client/server
     connection information. 

     Other utility programs to manage connections, including a sample
     program that can send text messages to clients. 

     A special version of the client program and shell script that sends
     short samples of audio data over the WWW as a CGI-BIN program.

License. The GNU GPL is gives everyone the right to have access to the

Cyber Radio 1 is intended for radio stations with a fast connection to
the Internet to broadcast their sound on. It is especially hoped that
other computer hackers that work in college radio will attempt to use
it and perhaps improve it.


Although it is not as sophisticated as Cu-See-Me, RealAudio, or other
net audio software, the sound quality of CR1 is better suited for
music. In addition, the client and server processes use minimal CPU and
network resources.


Cyber Radio 1 has been written in C and will compile on any UNIX
system. After downloading the package, read the file labeled "INSTALL"
for instructions on how to build it into a network audio broadcast system.
