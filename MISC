Also provided are several files for "hackers only".
Everything is provided "as is", and doesn't get my general support.


The first is the WWW demo programs.  This is a modified version of the
client program that WREK uses to send sample audio bits over the web
as .au soundfiles.

wwwdemo.c was hacked to work under Solaris, and is provided.
Also included is the CGI-BIN script used to run the "web_demo".
It's actually an older version, of the CR1, but stil compatible.

You will need the program "raw2audio" available on most Sun's
in the /usr/demo/SOUND directory to correctly put a header on 
the file that is generated.

If I recall correctly, this program is not distibuted under Solaris, but
the source and binary were distributed with SunOS 4.  You can probably
find an implementation for this program on the net.  I can't distribute
this program, because Sun owns the rights to it.

corresponding files: wwwdemo.c and  wwwdemo.cgi



Finally:
 Are there any Python hacker out there in the audience?

 This is an implementation of the client program written in Python,
 a way cool language.  It requires that the Sun Audio package be installed.

corresponding file: cr1.py
