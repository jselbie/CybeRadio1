The WREK-NET protocol is as follows.  See the packet format
listings for details on how specific parts of each message
is sent out.


1) For a client to establish a connection with a server it sends
   out a CLIENT packet to the server host with the op-code
   set to REQUEST.  The port number that services it desire on
   defaults to 9110 unless it is changed with the -p command line option.
   The port that this packet leaves on is usually set by the OS 
   and is not important.

2) When the server receives the CLIENT packet, it in turn starts
   sending out SERVER packets that contain audio data.  The op-code
   in each packet is set to AUDIO_ULAW.

3) Every 20 seconds, the client program sends out a REQUEST packet
   identical to what it sent out in step 1.  This is so that the
   server system knows the client is still connected.

4) Should the CLIENT ever want to disconnect from the server is
   sends a client packet with the op-code set to TERMINATE.

5) If the server ever wants to send a text message to the user
   running a client program, the text string must be encapsulated
   as data in a SERVER packet and the op-code is set to TEXT.

6) Should the server even want to disconnect from a client,
   the op-code of the SERVER packet must be set to TERMINATE.
