cr1 - Cyber Radio 1 client reception program

SYNOPSIS
  cr1 [ -a device ] [ -p port ] [ -i server address] [-r server port] [ -o ]


DESCRIPTION
Typing "cr1" at the command line of a workstation that has sound
support will connect to the default server and begin playing received
data on the audio device.


REQUIREMENTS
	This program only will work under the following conditions:

	1)	The user running the program is sitting at the console
		of the computer that is to play the sound.  A "dialup"
		connection with a modem or remote login will not work.

	2)	A sound device is available for use.  It must be configured
		for 8-bit/8000hz uLaw data. 

	3)	The connection to the Internet must be fast.  A minimum
		transfer rate of 8,000 bytes/sec is needed for this
		to work.  Thus, a modem connection such as "slip"
		(or any similar type connection) will cause unpredictable
		results.


STARTING THE PROGRAM
	To begin receiveing audio data and to have it played out the
workstation speaker, type "cr1" at your shell prompt to start a connection
with the CR1 server.  Command line options described below will allow the
user to configure his sound and network connection.


ENDING THE PROGRAM
	To disconnect from the server and end the radio session, a simple
"CTRL-C" will end the program.  If "cr1" is running in the background, 
then either bringing the program to the foreground and then hitting "CTRL-C"
will disconnect the computer as well.  Exiting from a shell in which the
program was started from, will disconnect as well.  A message is displayed
on the screen to indicate that the program has ended.


OPTIONS
Normally, "cr1" with no command line options will be sufficient to
start the system.  Command line options are to customize the connection
and sound device.

	-a	Send the audio to an alternate character device specified as
		"device".  The default audio device is /dev/audio.  On some
	 	systems, the 8-bit/8000hz sound device is /dev/audio1.  This
		is also useful for sending output to a specific console
		window such as /dev/tty1 or such.

	-p 	Port number for the server to send data to.  Be default,
		this is 9222.  However, any port between 1025 and 65535 can
		be used.

	-i	Specifies the ip address of the server that you want to
		start a session with.  The default is the machine name
                identified by SERVER_NAME in the file cr1.h.

	-r	Specifies the UDP port of the server that you want to
		start a session with.  The default is 19222 or whatever
		number was pre-compiled.

	-o	Send the audio to standard ouput.  This is useful of
		displaying the audio data to the screen or to have
		audio redirected to a file.  Audio will not be sent
		to the audio device if this option is used.  Please
		remember, that if redirection to a file is used, the
		the program writes data to the file system at a rate
		of 8000 bytes/sec.  You could overfill the filesystem
		if you leave this running too long.


DEBUGGING
	If no sound is heard, then use the -o option to have the audio
data displayed as characters.  A constant stream of the same character
indicates that server may be "off the air" or not sampling any signal.
If the server is not up and running, a message indicating a failed connection
is displayed.

===========================================================================
server - Samples digital audio and sends to all currently connected clients

SYNOPSIS
  server [ -a device ]  [-i] 

The "request" program must already be running before this program is started.

An explanation of the command line parameters is as follows:

        -a      Read the audio from an alternate character device specified as
                "device".  The default audio device is /dev/audio.  On some
                systems, the 8-bit/8000hz sound device is /dev/audio1.

        -i      Read the audio input from standard input.  Useful for
                piping a client running the -o option into a server
                to be used as a reflector.


===========================================================================
bconsole - the broadcast console


SYNOPSIS
  bconsole


  Typing bconsole at the prompt displays all the current connections at
  that moment.  A program command prompt follows.

  Commands to the broadcast console are as follows:

  l - Typing "l" presents an updated list of currently connected clients
      This command can take an optional numeric argument for displaying
      just a single "channel slot".

  d # - Typing "d" followed by a numeric argument will force a disconnection
        from the client in that slot.  The client program is left hanging
        with not indication of what happened.

  q - quits the bconsole program

============================================================================
terminate - terminates a connection to a client

SYNOPSIS
  terminate ip [port]

  "terminate" sends a message to a remote client informing it to stop.
  
  When a terminate message is sent to a machine running the CR1 client
  program, the client immediately terminates.  

  "ip" is the IP address or DNS name of the client.

  "port" is an optional numeric argument.  It's used to send a terminate
   message to a client that is not connected on the default port.

  IP address and port numbers can be obtained from the broadcast console
  program.  The request and server programs may not know about the
  disconnection until about a minute later.  It is recommended that
  this program be used with the "d" command in the broadcast console.


============================================================================
talk - send a message to the client program to be displayed on the screen.


SYNOPSIS
  talk ip [port]

  Very similar to terminate, except sends a text message to be
  displayed on the client's screen.  Currently, all this program
  does is send the message "hello, world."
